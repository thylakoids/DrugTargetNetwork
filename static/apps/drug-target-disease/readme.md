# Target-Disease Network
**therapeutic targets database**

From **DrugBank** we get the drug(cas-number)-target(Uniprot) relationship, now we need to map connect the target to disease.

output : most related drugs, drug combinations
### Gene expression Omnibus(GEO)
It is a transcriptional data repository.

## potential drugs
### PPI network construction 
Find lung cancer related target using TTD, and build PPI using STRING.

lung_cancer related uniprot:125

convert to string id:121

next : build a PPI network
nodes:125
edges:870
### find hub nodes
degree, betweenness and closeness(assign a importance value to each node )
### find potential drugs
hub target nodes related drugs(assign a importance value to each drug)

observation:
* multi-target drugs are often low-affinity binders

drug_ip = sum(target_degree+1)/count(target)
## potential drug combinations
### PPI network construction
Find lung cancer related target using TTD, and build PPI using STRING.
### Synergy score for each drug combination
topology score
